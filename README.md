# 60 Days of Data Engineering

Inspired by **#100DaysOfCode**, I've decided to challenge myself into becoming a Data Engineer by studying and building Data/ML pipeline for 10-12 hours every day for the next 60 days. This started today 3rd of September and should be finished by 4th of November, 2019. My focus will be on ML/DL pipeline and Data Engineering tools around it such as KubeFlow, Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and Tensorflow. I will document my progress on Github and update daily logs in LinkedIn.
