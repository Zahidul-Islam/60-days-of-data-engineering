# 60 Days of Data Engineering

Inspired by **#100DaysOfCode**, I've decided to challenge myself into becoming a Data Engineer by studying and building data/ML pipeline for 10-12 hours everyday for next 60 days (#60DaysOfDataEngineering).This stared September 3, 2019 and should be finished by November 4, 2019. My focus will be on ML/DL pipeline and Data Engineering tools around it such as KubeFlow, Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka and Tensorflow. I will document my progress on Github and update daily logs in LinkedIn.
