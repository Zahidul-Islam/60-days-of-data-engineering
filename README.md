# 60 Days of Data Engineering

Inspired by **#100DaysOfCode**, I've decided to challenge myself into becoming a Data Engineer by studying and building Data/ML pipeline for 10-12 hours every day for the next 60 days. This started today 3rd of September and should be finished by 4th of November, 2019. My focus will be on ML/DL pipeline and Data Engineering tools around it such as KubeFlow, Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and Tensorflow. I will document my progress on Github and update daily logs in LinkedIn.

# Day 5: September 7, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Today was no a productive day. Only finish Week 1 content of **Natural Language Processing with Tensorflow** course.

**Thoughts:** I am excited and looking forward to start **Insight Data Engineering Fellows Program** on September 9th 2019.

# Day 4: September 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Today I finished the **Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning** course on Coursera.

**Thoughts:** It was not a difficult course. However, it gave me a solid understanding of Tensorflow 2.0 API and Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). Building some simple image classifiers were fun.

## Day 3: September 5, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Today I started **TensorFlow in Practice Specialization** from `deeplearning.ai`. I am in week 4 of **Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence** course. 

**Thoughts:** I like the way **Al Advocate** (Instructor) introduced Convolutional neural network by building a simple classifier using fashion mnist dataset and Tensorflow. **TensorFlow in Practice Specialization** is hands-on. Looking forward to learn more about TensorFlow.

## Day 2: September 4, 2019
**Today's Progress:** I wrote a blog post on LinkedIn where I explained Apache Airflow core concepts.  

**Thoughts:** There are so many interesting concepts in Airflow. It is an excellent tool for workflow orchestration. I want to spend more time on building custom **Operator**, **Hook** and data pipeline.

## Day 1: September 3, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Spent time learning about Apache Airflow. Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. Link: https://airflow.apache.org/index.html

**Thoughts:** Very happy with my progress, and excited to start building a Dynamodb to BigQuery ETL pipeline using Airflow tomorrow.

**There are so many excellent blogs on Airflow. Today I want to share some beginner-friendly resources:**
